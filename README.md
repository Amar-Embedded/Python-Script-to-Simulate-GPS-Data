Project Description: GPS Data Simulation in Python
This Python project simulates GPS data and processes it efficiently with added features like error handling, debug messaging, and argument parsing. The program mimics a GPS system by generating and processing latitude, longitude, and timestamp data, ensuring reliability with structured error handling and graceful termination.

Modules used: Pynmea2, Keybaord, Time, Sys.

Key Features:
GPS Data Simulation:

The program generates random GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) and simulates continuous movement by adjusting the coordinates over time.
Customizable time intervals allow the simulation of real-time GPS data.

Reading GPS Data File:

A GPS data file is read to extract latitude and longitude. This file is a nmea file.
Extracted data is processed to create a payload that includes these coordinates along with a timestamp.

Data Formatting:

The extracted data (latitude, longitude) is formatted and combined with the current timestamp to create a structured payload for further use (e.g., transmitting or logging GPS data).

Error and Exception Handling:

The program includes robust error handling to manage scenarios like file read errors, invalid data, or exceptions during data generation.
It logs meaningful error messages for easy debugging.

Debug Messages:

Debug logging is implemented to trace the flow of the program and output useful messages for developers.
The level of debug output can be adjusted via command-line arguments, providing flexibility in the depth of information displayed during execution.

Argument Parser:

The program uses an argument parser to allow customization of the simulation. Arguments can include input file paths, GPS simulation parameters (like time intervals), and log levels for debug output.

Graceful Script Termination:

The program is designed to quit gracefully when interrupted, ensuring proper cleanup and termination without delay or corruption of data.

Achievements:

Simulated GPS Data: Randomly generated latitude and longitude data mimicking real-time GPS movement.
Extracted and Processed GPS Data: Successfully read and formatted data from a file, adding timestamp and handling data flow.
Exception Handling: Implemented structured error handling to manage potential runtime issues.
Logging and Debugging: Added debug messages for easy troubleshooting, with an argument parser to control debug levels.
Graceful Termination: Ensured the program quits smoothly, managing interruptions or user exits.
This project simulates GPS data while ensuring flexibility, reliability, and developer-friendly debugging tools, making it a comprehensive solution for GPS data simulation.
